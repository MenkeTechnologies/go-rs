// Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
//
// This is the subset of the standard library's `io` that go-rs can both parse
// and give meaning to. The full package is built on `sync`, `errors` and a
// dozen adapter types whose behaviour is only observable through a real file
// descriptor; what a Go program actually names when it writes portable code is
// the `Reader` / `Writer` interfaces and the rune-at-a-time `RuneReader` /
// `RuneScanner` that `bufio` and `fmt`'s scanners speak, the helpers over
// them (`WriteString`, `ReadAll`, `ReadAtLeast`, `ReadFull`), and the sentinel
// errors they report. The declarations are Go's own.

// but failed to return an explicit error.

// Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
//
// Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream. It returns
// the number of bytes written and an error if fewer were written than asked.
// Implementations must not retain p.
type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

// StringWriter is the interface that wraps the WriteString method.
type StringWriter interface {
	WriteString(s string) (n int, err error)
}

// WriteString writes the contents of s to w, which accepts a slice of bytes. A
// w that implements StringWriter is asked directly, which lets an
// implementation avoid the copy that converting s to []byte would cost.

// EOF is the error returned by Read when no more input is available.
// (Read must return EOF itself, not an error wrapping EOF,
// because callers will test for EOF using ==.)
// Functions should return EOF only to signal a graceful end of input.
// If the EOF occurs unexpectedly in a structured data stream,
// the appropriate error is either [ErrUnexpectedEOF] or some other error
// giving more detail.
var EOF = errors.New("EOF")

// ErrUnexpectedEOF means that EOF was encountered in the
// middle of reading a fixed-size block or data structure.
var ErrUnexpectedEOF = errors.New("unexpected EOF")

// ErrNoProgress is returned by some clients of a [Reader] when
// many calls to Read have failed to return any data or error,
// usually the sign of a broken [Reader] implementation.

// Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.
//
// Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes
// read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read
// returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
// If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally
// returns what is available instead of waiting for more.
//
// When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after
// successfully reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of
// bytes read. It may return the (non-nil) error from the same call
// or return the error (and n == 0) from a subsequent call.
// An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
// a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may
// return either err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should
// return 0, EOF.
//
// Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before
// considering the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors
// that happen after reading some bytes and also both of the
// allowed EOF behaviors.

	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)

// ReadAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read.
